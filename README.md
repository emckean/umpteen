What's Umpteen?
===================

Umpteen is a little npm module to help you spell out numbers in words.

UMPTEEN IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT. Still in the "write a bunch of tests" phase. I'm workin' on it as fast as I can. :-) 

Why Umpteen?
===================
Why not?
Also: words > numbers.

Using Umpteen
===================
Testing
-------
Run tests with mocha in the /test directory. 
```
mocha /test/test.js
```

Thanks and acknowledgements
===========================
Umpteen was inspired by Landon Curt Noll's print-the-numbers perl script, which is way better and fuller-featured than this module. You should check it out: http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/math/number/number
